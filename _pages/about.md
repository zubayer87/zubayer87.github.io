Hi, my name is Zubayer Islam, I am currently working as a Post-Doctoral Scholar in the University of Central Florida.

My research portfolio covers a broad domain of smart cities in the field of transportation safety and mobility. My interdisciplinary background in `Civil Engineering (Ph.D.)`, `Computer Science (M.S.)`, and `Electrical Engineering (B.S.)` put me in a favorable position to pursue transportation engineering questions from an unique perspective. I have published several scientific articles relating to the application of transportation using machine learning and artificial intelligence in several prestigious journals. I have collaborated with several individuals from five different countries across diverse backgrounds. I have also assisted my supervisor in writing several grant applications. During my postdoc, I have mentored several students and have led several projects. I have served as the committee member of two Ph.D. and three M.S students.  I aim to tackle various challenges in smart sensing, smart mobility, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

I have also gained teaching experience as an Adjunct Faculty in the University of Central Florida where I have taught Introduction to Smart Cities.
