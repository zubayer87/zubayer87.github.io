Hi, my name is Zubayer Islam, I am currently working as a `Post-Doctoral Scholar` in the University of Central Florida.

My research portfolio covers a broad domain of smart cities in the field of transportation safety and mobility. My interdisciplinary background in `Civil Engineering (Ph.D.)`, `Computer Science (M.S.)`, and `Electrical and Eletronic Engineering (B.S.)` put me in a favorable position to pursue transportation engineering questions from an unique perspective. 

I have published several scientific articles relating to the application of transportation using machine learning and artificial intelligence in several prestigious journals. I have also assisted my supervisor in writing several grant applications. I have served as the committee member of two Ph.D. and three M.S students. I aim to tackle various challenges in  `smart sensing`, `smart mobility`, `big data analytics`, `artificial intelligence`, and `machine learning`.

I have also gained teaching experience as an Adjunct Faculty in the University of Central Florida where I have taught Introduction to Smart Cities during Fall 2022.
